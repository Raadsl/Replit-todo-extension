# TODO LIST
The first todo list extension on Replit! Keep track with what you still need to do! (probably a lot). It uses the FS and messages API from Replit extensions, and the replitCSS lib from @Hecker40 and automatically adjusts to your custom theme. It creates a .todo file to store it per Repl.
